## 🔌 Backend API Requirements

Your backend needs to implement these endpoints:

### Required Endpoints:

1. **GET /api/alerts/current**
   - Returns all active/current alerts
   - Response: `{ data: [{ id, title, message, hospitalName, bloodGroup, urgency, status, acceptedDonorsCount, createdAt, ... }] }`

2. **GET /api/alerts/past**
   - Returns all past/completed alerts
   - Same response structure as current alerts

3. **POST /api/alerts/:id/accept**
   - Donor accepts an alert
   - Request body: `{ donorId: "donor-uuid" }`
   - Response: `{ success: true, message: "Alert accepted" }`

4. **GET /api/alerts/:id/accepted-donors** (Admin only)
   - Returns list of donors who accepted the alert
   - Response: `{ data: [{ id, name, email, phone, bloodGroup, city, state, isEligible, ... }] }`

5. **POST /api/alerts/:id/mark-complete** (Admin only)
   - Marks alert as completed
   - Response: `{ success: true, message: "Alert marked as complete" }`
