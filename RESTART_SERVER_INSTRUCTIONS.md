# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Restart Server Required

## Current Status

✅ Database migration completed successfully
✅ Phone field added to User table
✅ All code updated to support phone field
❌ Prisma Client needs to be regenerated (permission error)

## The Problem

The Prisma Client generation failed with:
```
EPERM: operation not permitted
```

This happens because the NestJS server is currently running and has locked the Prisma client files.

## Solution: Restart the Server

### Step 1: Stop the Current Server

In the terminal where the NestJS server is running, press:
```
Ctrl + C
```

Wait for the server to fully stop.

### Step 2: Regenerate Prisma Client

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

This should now work without permission errors.

### Step 3: Restart the Server

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

## Verify Everything Works

After restarting, test the phone field:

### Test 1: Register a new donor with phone
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "firstName": "Test",
    "lastName": "User",
    "name": "Test User",
    "email": "test123@example.com",
    "phone": "9876543210",
    "password": "password123",
    "bloodGroup": "O_POSITIVE",
    "gender": "MALE",
    "dateOfBirth": "1990-01-01",
    "address": "123 Test St",
    "city": "Test City",
    "state": "Test State",
    "pincode": "123456",
    "emergencyContact": "9876543211"
  }'
```

You should see the phone field in the response:
```json
{
  "user": {
    "email": "test123@example.com",
    "phone": "9876543210",
    ...
  }
}
```

### Test 2: Login
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test123@example.com",
    "password": "password123"
  }'
```

The response should include the phone field.

## Alternative: Run the Test Script

After restarting the server, run:
```bash
node test-phone-field.js
```

This will automatically test all phone field functionality.

## What Was Changed

1. ✅ Database schema updated (phone field added to users table)
2. ✅ All DTOs updated to include phone field
3. ✅ All services updated to handle phone field
4. ✅ All API responses now include phone field

## Next Steps After Restart

1. Test the phone field functionality
2. Update your React Native app to send phone during registration
3. Update admin panel to display phone numbers
4. Consider adding phone number validation/formatting

**Remember:** Always stop the server before running Prisma migrations or generate commands!
